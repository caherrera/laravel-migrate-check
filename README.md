Laravel has a `migrate:status` command to check status of migrations. But this command mostly for humans. There are situations where one needs to know whether to run migrations when using autodeployment, maybe with switching to maintenance mode.

This package contains a `migrate:check` command that exits with number of pending migrations if there are any migrations to run.

## Requirements

This command supports all database drivers that Laravel does.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require caherrera/laravel-migrate-check
```

Thanks to Laravel 5.5 package auto-discovery the `migrate:check` command will be registered

## Usage

```bash
php artisan migrate:—Åheck
```

You can specify database and path to migration file via options just like they are used in `php artisan migrate` command
